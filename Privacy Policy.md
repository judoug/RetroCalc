1. Overview

RetroCalc is a simple calculator application for Meta Quest devices. It operates entirely on the device and does not collect, transmit, or store personal information, usage data, or device identifiers. This policy explains how (if at all) we handle data, and how you can request data deletion or contact us.

On-device processing only: All calculations and user interactions occur entirely on the Quest headset; no network access is involved, and no data leaves the device.

3. No Use of Advertising ID

RetroCalc does not access, collect, or use the Advertising ID or any other persistent device identifiers. 

4. No Third-Party Services or Sharing

Because RetroCalc does not collect or transmit any data, it does not share any data with third-party services, analytics platforms, advertisers, or any other parties.

Data Deletion: Since RetroCalc does not collect or store any personal or device data, there is no data to delete. If you believe otherwise, please contact us (see Section 7).

6. Security

Security measures: Since no data is collected or stored, there are no associated security risks within the app.
